<h1>BeingChef Project</h1>
<p>
    The project I am worked on as part of the CS5610 course is called BeingChef.
    BeingChef is all about solving the 'What should we make tonight?' problem for you.
	                    It enables enthusiastic cooks to experiment different cuisines, save favorite recipes for future
	                    reference, provide productive comments on recipes, for example: providing an alternative ingredient.
	                    It also provides users an easy way to fill their grocery lists with the ingredients of a paricular recipe that they
                    are viewing.

	I had an awesome experience while working on this project, I worked on various client and server side technologies and additionally, learned
	a lot about NoSQL database solutions: MongoDB.
