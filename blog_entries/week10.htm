<h1>Week 10 - Project Experiments</h1>
<p>
    The project I am working on is called BeingChef. It allows users to search for various recipes mark certain recipes as
    favorites, provide comments and ratings to recipes and also add the ingredients of the recipe to their
    grocery list. This week I performed experiments on various functionalities within the project: reviews and comments box,
    search pagination, login modal, custom user dashboard, public user dashboard.
