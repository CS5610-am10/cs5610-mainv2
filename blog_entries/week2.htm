<h1>Week 2 - Responsive Design</h1>
<p>
    Learning responsive design in week 2 was really interesting and awesome. In today's world, where we have so many kinds of 
    devices, varying in size it is important for a developer to build web pages which look good, both on a large and small screen device.
    So, this week we learned how we can achieve this using the <xmp>@media</xmp> query and define styling for differe screen size 
    segments.<br />
