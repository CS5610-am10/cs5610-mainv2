<h1>Week 4 - jQuery</h1>
<p>
    In order to improve user experience, a web page must be armored with cool effects, animations, dynamic content specific to
    the user and assistive widgets. This week we learned jQuery and it supports all these features: we can assist the user with
    auto-complete input box, improve user experience through the shadow and animate functions, provide user interaction through
    draggable and resizable functions.
