<h1>Week 5 - AJAX, Web API, Angular.js</h1>
<p>
    This week I learned about using AJAX to request JSON data from a server
    and using Angular.js to dynamically modify the Document Object Model.
    It was interesting to learn the simplicity and the power of using Angular.js. A lot of work which took
    about 15-20 lines with jQuery can be attained with about 5 lines with Angular.js
