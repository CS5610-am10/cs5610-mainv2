<h1>Week 7 - Node JS</h1>
<p>
    This week I learned create a simple server using Node JS. Along with serving static html pages, in the
    Node JS server we can also define REST API endpoint and perform GET, PUT, DELETE AND POST on the entity.
    It is amazing to learn how we a few lines of code we can have a server performing various functions which 
    would have been a little complex to implement in plain java, especially having dynamic endpoints.
