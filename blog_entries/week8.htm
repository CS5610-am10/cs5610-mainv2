<h1>Week 7 - Node JS</h1>
<p>
    This week I learned a NoSQL storage system: MongoDB in which we can directly persist JSON documents
    in collections. Also, we learned how we can directly embed some child data directly into the parent entity without using
    any foreign references like done in relational database systems. This enables fast access of data in our applications
    Also, using the 'mongoose' module in NodeJS we can have documents schema enforcement.
