                This experiment shows how we can provide styling information at the tag level. However, this is not an industry standard of
                styling information. Professionally, we create a separate style sheet file to provide all the styling information.
            </p>
            <h4>Demo:</h4>
            <p style="background-color: maroon; color: green">
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h4>Code snippet:</h4>
            <xmp>
...
<p style="background-color:maroon; color:green"> ... </p>
...
</xmp>
            <p>
                As shown in the above code snippet, we used the <i>style</i> attribute of the tag to modify the background color and the text color of the text.<br />
                <i>Please note that the inline tag styling will take preference over the page level styling or any external style references.</i>
